Let's see, can we find a smart quote?

>You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.

## Sub headline lvl2

### Level 3

I am a paragraph, but I am referenced in a [footnote]^[I am the content of the footnote]

We just need to add some more things, so the page numbers become visible.

How about some code?

```
while (true) {
	print('ola');
	print('Infinite loops are not good.');
}
```
