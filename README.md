# Academical PDF from MarkDown
__Disclaimer:__ My understanding of LaTeX is fairly limited and the `mytemplate.tex` file is copy & pasted together from place I don't even remember.

This little script however, lets you build PDFs from your markdown files, including foot notes, page numbers and an automatic table of contents.

## Dependencies

* A package like pdflatex, lualatex or xelatex
* [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)

## Usage
`.build_pdf.sh`

## Known Bugs
* Fonts not applied
* some special chars cause build errors
